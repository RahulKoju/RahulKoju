# Hi there! 👋

I’m still figuring things out — building projects, making mistakes, and refactoring a lot.  
I care about understanding systems properly, not just making things work.

Currently working with **Next.js**, and slowly learning **DevOps and scalability**.  
Trying to get better at **clean code, system design, and real-world engineering**.
